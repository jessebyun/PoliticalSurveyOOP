# Political Survey OOP

## 🗳️ About the Project
This is a **Java-based Political Survey** program that predicts a user's political affiliation based on their responses to multiple-choice questions. The program uses **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles to organize the questions, process user inputs, and make a political guess.

## 📌 Features
- **Interactive survey** with multiple-choice questions.
- **Early prediction system** that estimates political leaning before all questions are answered.
- **Final prediction** based on average scores from responses.
- **User-friendly interface** with simple question prompts.
- **Object-Oriented Design (OOP)** to ensure modularity and scalability.
